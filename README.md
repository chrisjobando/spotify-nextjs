# Spotify Next Player
This is a refactor of a previous project I worked on last year. I made my authentication client-side through Next's Dynamic API routing and updated my code to be a lot cleaner, organized, and readable! I also added React Hooks and Context API, which were released in the past year. There is still some more work to be done with this project, but it is near complete parity with the original!
